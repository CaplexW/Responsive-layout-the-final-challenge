# Conquered Responsive Layout!

This is my [solution](https://caplexw.github.io/Responsive-layout-the-final-challenge/) for the final challenge of Kevin Powell's course [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts). It's a very simple web-site the main point of which was to gather all the knowledge from all the lessons of the course and build the site from design pdf file with some additional conditions and make it responsive across all the screen sizes from 320 to 1920 px. 


### Used tools
- HTML Semantic markup
- CSS Custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first approach

### Useful resources
I Highly recommend this [course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) for it's good quality content, especially if you struggle with CSS and don't really know what to do with it. This course not olny gave me more understanding of CSS and responsive design, it also gave you more deep understanding what I don't understand about CSS where to go next to improve my skills.
